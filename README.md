# S3andAWScli

S3 and AWS-CLI

In this lab I made a quick s3 bucket, uploading files into the bucket and deleting them. Also tried to use the cli to view what is in the bucket.

I made a bucket and connected into the instances and used the cli to connect to the bucket using my authorization keys. Though I had a lot of connection setbacks I was able to get it working by rechecking my previous steps and making sure I had the right keys and access into the bucket using the aws s3 commands. I am able to view my aws credentials and list what is inside the bucket which is a zip file.
